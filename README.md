# boomstick
Minetest mod that adds boomsticks and other weapons. This mod draws inspiration from [rangedweapons](https://github.com/daviddoesminetest/rangedweapons) and is intended to be a complete rewrite and spritual successor.

## To-Do:
- [x] Implement basic weapon mechanics (shooting, reloading, running out of
  ammo)
- [ ] Emit a temporary light source upon firing (muzzle flash)
- [ ] Smoke particles
- [ ] Projectile particles
- [ ] Doors and glass should break when fired at with certain weapons
